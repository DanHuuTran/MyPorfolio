# Northeast US States Real Estate Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains a simple data analysis project focused on real estate in a Northeastern U.S. state while I was obtaining my Google Data Analytics Certificate. The goal of this project is to explore and analyze real estate data to gain insights into market trends, property values, and other relevant factors.

## Dataset
The datasets used in this analysis is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jayoza198/realtor-data), and it includes information on real estate transactions, property details, and other relevant features. The dataset is available in the data directory. The data is downloaded and imported to SQL Server Management Studio for data cleaning and manipulation.

## Dashboard
This project uses Power BI Desktop, a free Microsoft Power Platform profuct to generate an interative dashboad. The link to the actual dashboard is in the files folder.

## Key Findings
1. New York has the  largest market values and highest population out of the states included in the dataset, meaning there are more options for companies to explore.
2. New Jersey and Massachusetts has higher median income and and lower average home values compared to New York, making it easier for homebuyers to reside in these states.
3. Georgia has the highest population growth in the past ten years, and the trend tends to continue. Demands for housing in Georgia will likely continue to rise.
4. In contrast, Puerto Rico has negative population growth in the mean time along with lowest median income. Demands for housing in this state will likely decline. However, this could be an opportunity for some companies that might try to acquires lands and houses for fraction of the cost compared to other states while waiting for better time.
5. Vermont, Delaware, Rhode Island, and New Hamshire all have relatively high median income, low population and average home values, making it difficult for realtor and real estate companies to predict based on available data.
